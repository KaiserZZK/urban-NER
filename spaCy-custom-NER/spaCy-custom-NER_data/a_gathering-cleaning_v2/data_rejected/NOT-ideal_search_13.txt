@the_transit_guy I admittedly know relatively little about NYC and do not pretend any expertise. However, couldn't much of this be turned into two-way loop systems? This would unite many isolated lines.

Just filled a 20 person brunch for NYC VCs in a matter of hours.If you‚Äôre a VC in NYC and want to get in the loop on social events in the city, I run a WhatsApp group that‚Äôs at 195 folks so far.Dm me to get added :)

Wish there was a sprawling suburban commuter rail system here just like there is in the NYC area. Also wish there was a loop metro line that followed the beltway. WMATA is not useful for anything except going into/out of the DC core. Or passing from one end to the opposite end.

@kevin_raiders Closed loop systems with air purification recirculate the virus throughout the system. Lessons learned from the NYC portion of the quasi lockdown...painful lessons. Now, how do schools put in ventilation that cures this? Beats the hell outta me.

@dsevic2 @tweetyalexander @JLEdwardsIII Again, youve never been to Chicago. You have a very poor understanding of Chicago neighborhoods. My comparison of "The Loop" to FiDi in NYC is a good one. Unfortunately youve never been to either of those cities so it was lost on you.

Just booked a train ticket to NYC for $28/each way for Labor Day weekend. I've got to see A Strange Loop, and it'll be a nice little getaway after school starts and before surgery.

@guidoacasa Guido, we're in a taxi twitter loop here. TfL have wide powers. We provided a QC opinion on this which TfL have never addressed. in NYC there was no specific regulation addressing worker rights but it didnt stop the Mayor there taking effective action. Enough of the helplessness.

@raspberry_gem Philly has one of the most vibrant and active city centers in the US. I honestly think only Chicago and NYC compare really and even then Center City might be better than midtown or the Loop for actual living.

@truzzi It didn‚Äôt get the Tony for bravery. It got the Tony for excellence. We live in NYC &amp; see everything. A Strange Loop is one of the most brilliant pieces of theatre I‚Äôve ever seen. Profound, funny, raw, irreverent, moving. You don‚Äôt like it, go see Phantom.
