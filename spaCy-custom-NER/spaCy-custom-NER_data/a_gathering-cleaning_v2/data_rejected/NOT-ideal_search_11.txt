For everyone suggesting I drive, I have done it, with a dog, in January. It took me nine hours. The problems are I don't know how to rent car one-way from Toronto to NYC (I did the reverse), I would have to cancel my ticket to fly back, and parking a car in NYC for a week is $$$.

@Kleion_Channel Yeah! :D It's a 4 hour drive to NYC! &lt;3

@karenkho I would rather drive than fly for anything less than a 11 hour drive.  Probably lower carbon footprint than flying, and the drive to NYC this time of year is beautiful.  Chance to enjoy nature on the way.  Can always break it up over multiple days to be less taxing.

@_figensezgin I love how the van was like "let me not get in the way of their fingers, friends."If this had been in NYC, the van drive would have had his window down and giving the finger too. üòÇ

@LeeDoesStuff I lived in a small town outside of NYC that had a gay nightclub, social scene and served as an easy drive for someone to have a second home. No one was out in my school. The bullying would have been intense even though it wasn‚Äôt unusual to see adults in our community. 1/2

URI Deputy CEO Carla Smith was proud to join @NYCMayor, @bronxbp, &amp; @SheenaWrightNYC at the Mayor's announcement of payments of backlogged funds owed to NYC nonprofits. This overdue funding will drive positive impact for all New Yorkers. https://t.co/D7qmhQ77vi

@CeejayRobb @CKscullycat I listen the WDAS when I drive to NYC.

@karenkho Buy two refundable tickets w diff airlines and go to NYC two days early. Then if there is a problem w/ flying in general you have plenty if time to drive. Im an airline employee who commuted for 16 years. Time is the best friend you can get for yourself.

@coach215 @FDRLST &amp; NYC. It gives an unfair advantage to red states. The states that drive this nation are deprived of good leaders &amp; forced to live with corrupt GOP presidents. Republicans cannot govern.

@jduffyrice For population density NYC is one of the safest places compared to many other cities. I bet that a lot of the coverage is out of state as well. Makes you wonder how people in positions of power can drive media coverage so easily.

@BrentToderian If you get rid of cars, you need busses or light rails. NYC is doing a crappy job improving public transportation. We have no easy way to get around in the outer boroughs. But they still want to take parking away so we drive and double park illegally with the engines running.

@iSowelu @nypost If you're filling a 15 gal. tank 2-3 times a week, $2 less per gallon is a huge savings (approximately $360 a month). And two miles is really not a far drive outside of NYC.

@PatrioticDemNY @BobHoldenNYC @NYC_DOT Nothing about that intersection requires any vehicle to "hop on top" of the bollard or raised area of pavement. Just because you're in an suv and see an urban boulder doesn't mean you must or should drive over it.

Panhandling in the middle of the Harlem River Drive, the FDR Drive and the Major Deegan Expressway is a new trend, because sitting and watching approvingly as civilization decays is the "in" thing.https://t.co/Uv6UUNgWBc

I have no idea why but once you hit NYC/NJ every motherfucker forgets how to drive. Just stopping for no reason at all going 19 in a 55. https://t.co/p4HUVzA1HO

@KamerynJW Boise IS a long drive from anywhere tho (anywhere = NYC)

If I ever say I wanna drive in NYC consider that a cry for help

Today's when I drop Ren off at Fordham university in NYC for a weeklong theater program. I'm really proud of them for getting into this and hope it's a great experience. Then I drive 5+ hours home. Yay.

LGBTQ+ people exist outside big cities and deserve equitable access to vaccinations. Having to drive to Chicago or fly to NYC to access a vaccine is ridiculous, @IAPublicHealth, and will increase contagions in short- and long-term especially but not solely in the queer community.

@Spatial_Punk We made that NH-to-Dewey drive at least once a summer as a kid. I still remember the smell of the Jersey turnpike as you leave NYC.And the glory of St. George's bridge in Delaware...that meant we were close!

@BBerries @Clodia55680147 @DoctorRevan @Space_Lenin @safenuclearstuf @poppy_haze @MandelaFace @conor64 ‚ÄúA long drive from anywhere‚Äù is such a funny tell that you‚Äôve lived in NYC your whole life. If your city is a long drive from anywhere that means it‚Äôs a regional metropole!

@sunshinegirl545 If you could afford it, would you buy an electric car? No?-Even Geraldo Rivera now has an EV in NYC &amp; he says that he would not dare drive that car to his house in Ohio in fear of getting stuck on the road he says even with charging stations it would take him four days.

@dumgaymegan In NYC the limit is "34,000lb, plus 1000lb per ft of distance between the first and last axle". IDK if the first carrying wheel or the drive sprocket on a tank counts as the lead axle, but my example tank (an M24) fits in the limit with either of those options.

@Nimmabhaskar22 I guess to move in a line should be taught first. That wd help drive in lane, to cross pedestrian cross effciently, use escalators in metro station etc. Someone has to film these in Seoul, London and NYC and show to all in India.

I feel like its also worth pointing out that whilst a fucking children's water gun is illegal, you can legally daily drive a decommissioned tank in NYC https://t.co/K3Cmmd8CMQ

@MNTwinsZealot Miss Kirby.  Remember his induction like it was yesterday.  2001.  Stayed in NYC and watched Brooklyn Cyclones Friday night and saw Twin Towers on warm summer night drive back on Belt Parkway.  Drove to Cooperstown Sat AM.  Soak in everything.  It's magical

@HugoThePinkCat @hamburgator I go to college in a small town and cuz I grew up in NYC I never needed to drive. I sometimes hate being in the small town cuz I basically can't go anywhere because this country is so reliant on cars and I hate it so much

@Janet_McH @Tomaketu How many people drive into NYC for games/concerts/etc at MSG?   I think people are worrying way too damn much about this.

When you're in New York City, why not drive in a solar car?Today, the team braved the NYC traffic and construction to drive Aevum around Manhattan! We loved talking to the New Yorkers who saw us on the streets. So, let us know if we passed you!#SolarCarInNYC #MichiganSunRun https://t.co/duA5iBzGep

A great day trip is to drive up the CT coast from NYC to New London, catch the auto ferry here to Orient Point in LI, and drive back to NYC, eating lobster and clam along the way.

@CAgovernor You are leading the drive of major corporations out of your state. Ridiculous tax rates. Homeless numbers of the charts. A failing economy. Your DA are driving crime rates higher than almost anyone other than nyc and Chicago. Yep you‚Äôre doing a great job there buddy.

@AyinePLUR What's really messed up is the idea that you need to be able to drive to be successful like it isn't a ridiculously expensive investment. If you live in a larger city like NYC, you probably don't NEED a car because they have actual public transportation. We need more of it.

in the morning im driving up to Lowell, Mass for the Death Before Dishonor PPV. I'll have lunch with some friends and hang out a while, and then head to the  Tsongas Center. After the event I'll drive the 4 hours back to NYC. That drive to and from New England is amazing.

@DrHistoryBrad I grew up within view of the WTC in NJ. We loved taking the train back and forth from the city. I didn‚Äôt drive a car inside NYC till I was prob 30 or so.

They're afraid of losing their customers who choose to drive (sometimes from out of the city, or so they claim).
