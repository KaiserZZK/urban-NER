Why are diverse CBs important? It's a matter of life or death. When car-driving members @CB7queens scream @NYC_DOT, the City makes the politically-expedient decision to limit busway hours, not install protected bike lanes, etc. Result: 10001 crashes, 81 road deaths in past decade https://t.co/T42SsUvRFw

@enforcelawsNYC @TransAlt @NYC_DOT These saviors of the road don't care about community or the people who need to use them.  Why don't they ask the people in the Bronx if they want more bike lanes? They never asked us and just shoved them down our throats.  Same with open streets. Creates more congestion

@banovsky @Ben_Wojdyla @EzraDyer Not an either/or. No doubt state of road education abysmal in the US, a problem exacerbated by increasing prevalence of bluff, high-riding 5-7k lb vehicles w little outward visibility. But to drive in NYC w huge population of reckless unhelmeted e-bikers is to experience anarchy.

@pushtheneedle NYC's flooding predicted to increase by 2030 due to climate change. 37% of lower Manhattan will be vulnerable to storm surges. A 5-to-11" sea level rise would bring subway, road &amp; building flooding, large sections of the city becoming uninhabitable.https://t.co/cRDRCMSHIi
