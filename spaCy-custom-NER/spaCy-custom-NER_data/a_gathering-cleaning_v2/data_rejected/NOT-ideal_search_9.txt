@TramRios @TransAlt I look forward to the day when NYC's streets are filled with bike lanes, motorcycle lanes (for every type of small, powered vehicle going faster than a normal bike), and bus lanes. Pedestrians get the sidewalks back! And all those cars? They can get a single lane... maybe

@NYC_DOT @nyc311 How long until cops @NYPDTransit park their cars in the bike lane?

@NYC_DOT @nyc311 I'm still using Livingston Street.On your two way bike lanes, it's hard to see the traffic lights, turning cars are always a surprise, and half of bikers can't stay in a lane.No thank you. Better if just just repaved the road and ticketed double parkers.

@Sophia_in_NYC @mariem201 @YandR_CBS I don‚Äôt know the person and I‚Äôm not going to retweet etc but basically saying Sharon needs to stay in her lane bc she isn‚Äôt a therapist and that Adam Loves Sally and Sharon needs to stop. Didn‚Äôt Sally go to Sharon a while ago? Also on message boards and on here. People not happy

@joby_jacob @QnsRide @NYSDOT @Yewhomstda @StreetsblogNYC @QnsBPRichards @JimGennaro @LiuNewYork @NYC_DOT The reality is  pedal bikes are few and far between on the QB bike lane around FHs

@LAShepard221 @NYC_DOT As opposed to what is called for when it comes to everyone and everything else? flow functionality for commerce everyday usage emergency/alternate routes evacuation There is nothing ‚Äòcritical‚Äô for a bike lane We r losing the city because of this &amp; all the related asinine policies

@NYC_DOT @nyc311 Any stats on pedestrians struck by bikes before &amp; after a bike lane? Stepping off the curb to enter or exit a restaurant's outdoor dining shed is a crapshoot these days.

@StreetsblogNYC @NYC_DOT Not so long ago at the base of the QB bridge on the Manhattan side. Not far from the bike lane. It would have gone into a group of cyclists waiting for the light. https://t.co/5vGX5TvHtB

@MPerren Glad your son is okay  Idk how many NYC taxi cabs got foot dents for cutting me off in the bike lane. I landed on the trunk of one because he pulled right in front of me and stopped. I didn't even have time to hit my breaks.

@NoBikeLanes @NYC_DOT @nyc311 Bro there is no parking being removed, a hole lane in the other direction is being removed that‚Äôs worst.

@NYC_DOT is continuing work on the Manhattan Bridge this week with the ongoing single-lane closure. The bike and pedestrian paths continue to be narrowed at work zones for a maximum of fifty feet. Please use caution when crossing the bridge. https://t.co/8J6lJ3nKbZ

@NYC_DOT @nyc311 What‚Äôs the plan for when NYPD employees park their personal vehicles in the bike lane?

@LincolnRestler @NYC_DOT What type of protection will be utilized for the bike lane? Bollards or Jersey barriers?

@LincolnRestler @NYC_DOT What are you/what is DOT going to do about the hotel loading zones (Ace, Holiday Inn, Hilton) + outdoor dining that's where the bike lane is planned? Would the north side of the street make more sense for the lane? Only one hotel (Even) on that side.

@joby_jacob @QnsRide @NYSDOT_NYC @NYC_DOT @LiuNewYork @DanRosenthalNYC @JimGennaro @DRichardsQNS It would be nice to have a concrete barrier starting after the dashed line ends, so as to prevent illegal lane-changes.But, even without that, the way Jewel Avenue is now is so much better than how it was before the bike lane, when it was essentially unusable for bikes.

Down memory lane. Fri was 35th anniv of Mayor Koch's edict banning bicycling in east midtown. A decade ago @StreetsblogNYC posted my weekly series recounting the uprising that stopped the ban. Here's Part 1: https://t.co/xRTSxbQOZz. Or download all five: https://t.co/QqYue0QPTO

@joby_jacob @QnsRide @NYSDOT @Yewhomstda @StreetsblogNYC @QnsBPRichards @JimGennaro @LiuNewYork @NYC_DOT Heading eastbound and home after those appointments, I took a different route (Jewel Ave) because I didn‚Äôt fancy having to negotiate the cross of Queens Blvd combined with crosses over Union Tpke required to get to that side path from the SE-bound Queens Blvd bike lane.

Hey @NYC_DOT @nyc311 Are you planning to repaint road markings on the stretch of Clinton St between Kane and Atlantic that was re-paved in mid June, or is it just gonna be high risk for crosswalk and bike lane users indefinitely? https://t.co/lUbfR9pg74

@SledTruth @BrooklynSpoke @Julcuba @BarmanNYC @StreetsblogNYC @D00RZ0NE @JessieSingerNYC @bikeloveny @Fresh_Kermit Convert 1 lane on every avenue into a micromobility lane protected from the other lanes. Do the same on the major streets (14, 23, 34, 42, 57, etc). And do the same on bridges. Not that hard. Will revolutionize NYC transport for cheap.

@qedkorc I just had the opposite experience in Chicago; tried to take transit / walking to a hotel. 3 transfers and two transit tickets later, I realized I needed to cross a 7-lane stroad. No sidewalks. NYC should make itself as hostile to cars as the rest of the US has to transit.

@NYCMayor NYC needs to get rid of restaurant sheds that take up valuable parking space. We have given up so much parking spaces with bike lane and yet people rather bike on the sidewalks instead of the bike lanes.  All primary NYC residents should have NY plates.
