@NYCMayor Photo ops vs stopping the massive rise in #Antisemitic attacks in #nyc  WOW #mayorsaycheese you only have one note and you keep picking it. #resign and take your sad act on the road.  #gsd in another state so we can live again

Has been a crazy busy week. Got back this AM from NYC where we covered the opening of the Jackie Robinson Museum @JRFoundation. Now back in DC. Editing pieces for #RolandMartinUnfiltered; meeting with sales team; looking at new shows on @BlkStarNetwork. Back on the road Saturday!

@jjays_captions Thank you James. The #road built over this #TaiChi group is FDR Highway in #Manhattan #NYC #Photography https://t.co/3YuohfVR3b

@AllySotton Chicago es alucinante. Y con respecto a EEUU, me haría muy, pero muy feliz, poder ir todos los años, por lo menos una semanita a NYC. Algún día haré un mega road trip. Es un país espectacular para recorrer...

@AnnmarieDodd @nwbx_nyc Is this on the HHP service road?

@CruBMXrideordie @veggycat @jay37854837 @TheArtOfWar6 You compared it to a rape people we r filming. These two want to fight in the road go for it. The Woke NYC government let's violent  blacks out with no bail. I'm not here her to fix that. I wouldn't even go there. Let em die.

So a picture frame I ordered has gone from Quebec, to Michigan, Ohio and now New Jersey. It's getting a nice little road trip and isn't set to arrive in NYC until 8/2. Lolz.

@MarkJoh95317502 @AP The US can’t get a 200m road fixed in a year, let alone building a factory. How about starting with renovation of NYC subway which smells like toilet first? 🤣🤣

@DanNaturals_ Haha yeah I've seen videos of NYC traffic and road rage. It's wild.

the first time i went to NYC i got a high score of 10k on Simpsons Road Rage just to be squashed a month later from Andrew getting a 20k high score. pics unrelated https://t.co/SgrjPw8LbX

@edsbs Japan, Australia and Greece: Japan is cool as long as you treat other cars like they are teens taking a road test. Australia is like the USA w/o the fear of being shot.Greece... Take NYC traffic, double it, put it on 1-95, add scooters w/ horns that honk constantly

@KRDemCT More to the point tho of safety in numbers and the more on the road -- no matter that reason, is helpful. There are rude roadies that scream and intimidate people in NYC esp, and even with the very well deserve and earned hate they get, they are adding critical mass.

@jjstyx @KuurlyHoward86 I’ve watched NYC ruin entire bridges by laying off the bridge painters. The Williamsburg bridge became dangerous and had basketball size holes in the supports. Then it became an emergency. New concrete columns, road bed etc.. Democrats love emergencies.

Something that may not be realized yet. But will. Every single person in attendance at the first @DeGodsNFT throw down in NYC should now have a personal relationship w someone that will benefit them in some capacity down the road.  #wefam https://t.co/GUiIWYZsaq

@SAPPHlCENJ0YER @HushedPrescott yeah, it makes sense tbh. especially if it’s a place that’s too far from nyc, like it takes 6 hours to travel from buffalo to nyc by road, why not take a 2 hour flight when you’re rich enough to afford it?

My wife just text me that our local homeless guy who yells at the bus stop is at McDonald’s yelling about Fred Flintstone right now. Goddamn. I miss being home. #NYC #road

y’all seen that video of that woman in houston shooting at a vehicle with a 2 year-old on board following a road rage dispute? nyc boutta be mayhem.

@SteveStuWill Would be interesting to see the difference in accident rates for the heavy road/touring bike vs the “crotch rocket” types. From what I see in driving behavior around where I live (NYC and burbs) big difference.

☀️On the road to your dreams the journey is long and the path may not be what you expected, but if you never give up and give your full effort no matter the outcome you should be proud of what you’ve accomplished ☯️#nyc #motivation #dreams #goals #concert #new #music #Dritto https://t.co/Mg3vzTnwvn

@alonso_purple Orlando’s road to the MLS  is no different than Sacramento.They could’ve been an MLS team if it wasn’t for finances of ownership. They have everything else going for them. And look how long it took us to get here we aren’t a LAFC, NYC or ATLANTA. Came up the hard way.

@FitzPaty @Julcuba @CitiBikeNYC The public doesn't know how to ride in a city, in its vast majority. Ever since citibike invaded, that is. Original NYC bikers were perfectly fine and knew how to SHARE the road.

@Bulldogwgr @CoolHandLuke716 Same for me to the State College show. Paid under $300 for a theatre in NYC last year to see Bruce on Broadway, completely worth it.

If the pedicab drivers of this family of 4 didn't lie to their passengers they could have taken 1 horse carriage together instead of 2 pedicabs illegally riding side-by-side blocking the road ahead! @NYPDCentralPark @NYCParks @helloDCWP @CentralParkNYC @NYC_DOT @NYCCouncil https://t.co/pfUaaIcZdq

@antibiaslaw @mattmfm @dahvnyc @CarolynBMaloney A bike lane in NYC, where folks don’t pay attention to any lines when in traffic, is a virtual death trap. The young man would have still been killed, a line on the road would not have stopped that. If you are talking about a line blockaded by concrete barriers, better chances.

@cardano_nyc Let's link up. I'm currently organizing a Road to @cNFTcon meetup in NY later this summer.

@paleonormie But like also a few blocks down on the main road you’re more likely to see homelessness (not a ton like you see in bigger cities) and a few boarded windows. Nowhere near NYC or SF but still a bummer to see what’s happened to pretty much all our cities

@Kenshin916916 Who’s at fault for Sokovia? Who paid for sokovia? DC? NYC? South Africa? Someone has to take responsibility for the avengers actions and the UN was ready to do that. I understand the idea of what if we aren’t allowed to go somewhere, but  you cross that road when it comes

Just saw a dude on a motorized wheelchair with a LICENSE PLATE driving down the road… NYC is different 😭

"Good guys with guns" are a myth!He pulled a gun on his neighbor.. who is black.. cause he  made a u-turn on the street. Accused him of "casing' his house. @NYPD sux!!Video: Off-duty NYPD cop pulls gun on L.I. neighbor after earlier road rage incident https://t.co/WLfi4m3b5E

@MiguelArias_D3 @CityofFresno Without proper infrastructure to provide safe options to get home, extending the cutoff will only increase the amount of intoxicated drivers on the road.NYC has a 4am cutoff, but has so many infrastructure options: taxi, subway, rideshare availability, even walking.

@NYC_DOT @nyc311 Sill waiting for the NYCDOT to post info on the proposed Richmond Road / Rockland Avenue / Morley Avenue redesign.

@CMCarlinaRivera @NYC_DOT @NYC_SafeStreets @TransAlt Hell yeah. In the long term we need road diets and traffic-calming measures to address reckless driving, but in the meantime camera enforcement is a great step.

@Firecaptain16 I'm actually super curious down the road if he's found guilty if he isn't ankle-home bound anywhere he wants (his Mar-A-Lago, or NJ or NYC...) and how they keep him from ongoing criming with his phone buddies willing to do the dirty deeds.

@NYC_DOT Does this apply to the North &amp; South Conduits where the speed limit is listed at 30? Which is still a ridiculously low speed to the service road of the Belt Parkway, one of the main roads into one of the world’s most major airports.

@CynnderellaD If he was in NYC to testify, why is this odd?We really shouldn’t go down the Qanonsense road of baseless speculation. There really are coincidences in this world and this particular coincidence (that they were about to testify) isn’t even shocking.
