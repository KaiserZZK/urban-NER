@AdamSchaffer15 Tbh the one way to use this against urbanists is to allow for conversions to residential in central business districts while relocating most offices to suburbs. In NYC, back in the days that CT had no state income tax, many companies relocated from NYC to CT.

@dagenmcdowell Grew up in the Bronx, live in CT now - it may be blue but CT still has a good balance and the town I'm in is very red!  Don't put your money in a city that spits on its citizens. NYC is the rotten apple again.  Be safe and make sure you're carrying.

@NYCountry947 I get this was the only country station in NYC, but as you can see, it‚Äôs not AUDACYS fault that it went to HD2. They had no choice. County music is not popular in NY, NJ, &amp; CT.

@fredstaffordcs @pwrhungry @Atomicrod @SteveAplin @RachelMotte @MadiHilly @energybants @nukebarbarian Some might say in it's own way NYC is similar in terms of an economy based on real estate. I am not sure the degree to which people in NYC realize how cheap "high end" real estate in places like Chicago and Lake Forest, IL is compared to Greenwich, CT and Manhattan.

@BrooklynNetcast Meh, not the reason he will test FA. Nets fans even if you remained from NJ days (like me) need to understand how privileged we are right now. Using NYC market was/is bigger advantage we ever had. I don't see NJ or CT as a different state. We are tristate, one big family.

@Robert_Welch914 @DrewScott_TV I live in CT but my part‚Äôs considered the NYC market so we only get WABC on most local providers and the ABC app. But WTNH often does local news stories from our city, and at least one of our universities carries both stations in its dorms.

@JosueAvila02 @TenLetters100 @TheFigen When 9/11 happened the country was melted to the ground for years. Half Manhattan residents moved to CT because it was the end. In the attack they didn't even have the organization or decency to scramble immediately fighter jets in the capital of the world. NYC.

@DirtyRolla @RatioWrld @AP Yes a square is a rectangle but not every rectangle is a square. The metro area otherwise known as the tri-state area includes NJ NY and CT. Your original point was that this happened in Nyc because it‚Äôs densely populated. The area it did happen is not the same.

@RudyMizel About 2 hours to the northeast of NYC is #Hartford #CT which has a rich heritage of #insurtech industry (for over 200 years). With several large &amp; major #insurance corporations - you may want to consider an office here too üòÉC: @InsurTechHfd @NReimagine @CTCaptives @Advance_CT

@ginged78 @BostonGlobe 2/That isn't unusual. You can see the mass of flights out of NYC to Islip, CT, NJ using tools like Flight Aware. Many executives do this who are just millionaires, but not in the top 1%, even though they do it too!

A great day trip is to drive up the CT coast from NYC to New London, catch the auto ferry here to Orient Point in LI, and drive back to NYC, eating lobster and clam along the way.

@ElvisFMon @kinda_kina @anti_pelumi @TerraDaValid that's honestly the same way i feel. i'm puerto rican. it's a SMALL island and i have a COMMON last name. there's such a high chance of someone i meet in the states (in NYC, Jersey, and CT specifically) being my cousin or something. üò≠

@Daniel_Rapaport Who is Dan Rapaport? I‚Äôve been following golf and sports all my life. I have never heard of him. It says he has over 100k followers. I grew up in Fairfield County, CT right outside of NYC. This is an insult to all the great people that live in or are from the Tri State area.

@NYCFranchise718 That's what I'm mostly referring to is out of towners and it's still a pretty long train ride from NYC. BFG is a bigger ppv than Rebellion. There are better places in CT like Bridgeport or New Haven
