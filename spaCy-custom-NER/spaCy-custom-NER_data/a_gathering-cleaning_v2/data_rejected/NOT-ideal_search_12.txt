@billy_darealest @the_transit_guy Yeah now Tampa rent is like 1/2 NYC‚Äôs, not 1/3 üòÇ. Tampa v NYC- they‚Äôre just different, both great cities, my personal preference is Tampa. Though I get why it‚Äôs not yours - temple terrace is very bleh. &amp; Car+FL rent is still less than Metro Pass+NY rent.

I left a lifetime in NYC partly because summers have become unbearable. They're heaven here in Seattle, even with heat waves, aka now. But, without a/c, it's a careful calculus each day about how long to keep windows/terrace door open before it makes the apt. hotter. Calling it. https://t.co/3RqyH1Ixqk

@trevorsumner Let‚Äôs talk about that NYC rare terrace and view, though ‚≠êÔ∏è

Was visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC a few years back &amp; was taking a break in their dining terrace. Suddenly someone sitting a couple tables away stood up and broke into song. Turned around to see Paul Sorvino- you could see the joy in his face. Farewell, sir. https://t.co/klSgQiAJr3
