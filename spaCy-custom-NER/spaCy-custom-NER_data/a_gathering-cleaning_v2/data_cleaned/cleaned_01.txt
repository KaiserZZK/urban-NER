@BluesNationCK @PrkSteakSchmuck @esbee23 @B1ackBruceWayne I lived in New York City for 27 years. There are dangerous places there, but crime also happens in Midtown Manhattan. My husband was mugged at 2:30 in the afternoon on Wall St.  We also had our car stolen in a "nice" neighborhood (Park Slope). St. Louis is not scarier than NYC.

More than 4,000 AAs were lynched across 20 states btwn 1877 &amp; 1950. 105 yrs ago today, July 28, 1917 nearly 10,000 AAs marched down 5th Ave, NYC, as what is known as the Silent Parade, to protest racial violence &amp; white supremacy in . Today we still face these same issues..

Great actor and was a very pleasant person. He frequently came to the Italian restaurant in NYC on 1st Ave  on the UES. He was awesome.  Times he would come and eat a $7.00 pasta meal and tipped the staff all individually. Usually their whole weeks pay in just one meal. Awesome.
@fredstaffordcs @pwrhungry @Atomicrod @SteveAplin @RachelMotte @MadiHilly @energybants @nukebarbarian business in Chicago on Michigan Avenue if there wasn't a lot of disposable income. I assume Bloomingdales kitty corner from the Hancock building is still doing a good business even if condos in the Hancock are insanely cheap compared to fancy NYC buildings..
@fredstaffordcs @pwrhungry @Atomicrod @SteveAplin @RachelMotte @MadiHilly @energybants @nukebarbarian Is it just that people in Chicago are "poorer" and that is why land is cheaper? Maybe, but even with the weaker Chicago economy compared to NYC there are still plenty of high end stores on Michigan Ave many of the same ones you see on Fifth Avenue. I don't think they would be in

@PitviperReese I am in that area often for family visits (they live in Greenpoint and we are often walking around in Williamsburg). Go to the East River - if possible at night on a rooftop - to see NYC skyline. Also Peter Pan on Manhattan Ave for bagel breakfast sandwiches. LOTS of good restos!

the initial story was that she was riding the wrong way and "fell off her bike". She was riding the correct way. Trucks of this length are illegal in NYC, it is illegal for any appropriately-sized truck not making a delivery to drive on this street.
Don't be distracted - the solutions haven't changed.This is a street that prioritizes two lanes for parking over safe cycling infrastructure. Safe bike infrastructure must come before parking.Additionally, NYC needs to set vision standards for truckshttps://t.co/dp0aP4VyS9
Related here is that @NYC_DOT failed to install protected a protected bike lane on East 85th Street after Community Board 8 voted it down in 2016. If this process weren't so broken, Carling Mott would be alive today. https://t.co/m16cwkpf6r

@tywalkerbelton1 NYC didn‚Äôt used to be like that, I‚Äôve visited there many times over the years and when their local government, meaning the Governor &amp; Mayor were committed to a safe NYC, it was a lot safer. Nowadays, people get arrested &amp; are back out on the street in 2-3 hours. That‚Äôs a problem

@Publicola_Lib21 My mother in law lives in Florida. It is better than NY in every way. We had virtually no homeless people on the streets for 20 years in NYC under Giuliani and Bloomberg. When DeBlasio came in he legalized street homelessness. Just like they did in California.
There‚Äôs a lot of justified skepticism of public-private partnerships out there, but a result that allows Breaking Ground to hire 100 more paid employees for outreach to street homeless New Yorkers should be deemed a plus. https://t.co/bVaMEDOUAf
