Pet peeve with the "combination pizza hut and taco bell" song. Is that it's trying to be street but, at least in NYC, is so middle class. Franchises aren't in the actual hood. In the hood that store is generically called "Chicken Pizza Taco" or some variation on that.

@KateWalther6 @murray_nyc @Peter_Fitz Have you watched a game? Indigenous representation is well over 3%. Non-white is 40%. numbers can be skewed either way. Indigenous Australians want to play. Take a walk down Oxford street and tell me how many gay men want to play. Not an insult. Just reality.

You tweeted about it once and I rarely see it enforced. Drivers do not care if you‚Äôre crossing the street.

@LincolnRestler @SindhwaniArvind @NYC_DOT Now that all that Westbound truck and car traffic will be rerouted to Atlantic Ave, what‚Äôs the plan for ‚ÄúBrooklyn‚Äôs Main Street?‚Äù Atlantic Ave can‚Äôt be expected to just bear the brunt and be ignored!

"The Department of Transportation proposed in 2016 to install a painted lane on East 85th Street, but it was shot down by the area‚Äôs community board, which was lobbied hard by private school parents ‚Ä¶ and Woody Allen." https://t.co/cD1sIdm6Ca

the initial story was that she was riding the wrong way and "fell off her bike". She was riding the correct way. Trucks of this length are illegal in NYC, it is illegal for any appropriately-sized truck not making a delivery to drive on this street.

Don't be distracted - the solutions haven't changed.This is a street that prioritizes two lanes for parking over safe cycling infrastructure. Safe bike infrastructure must come before parking.Additionally, NYC needs to set vision standards for truckshttps://t.co/dp0aP4VyS9

Related here is that @NYC_DOT failed to install protected a protected bike lane on East 85th Street after Community Board 8 voted it down in 2016. If this process weren't so broken, Carling Mott would be alive today. https://t.co/m16cwkpf6r

"NYC is giving away future property tax revenues and control over a big swath of Midtown property...in return for modest street-level infrastructure improvements that it could have paid for itself with the property taxes it was already collecting."https://t.co/f1wEdozPYg

@nicolegelinas It‚Äôs plain and simple- NYC is going to crap. Doesn‚Äôt make a difference what the police do, criminals are right back on the street anyway.

@JCtxASLAM @shannonrwatts @regnis_singer I have lived in Japan, South Korea and the USA. I lived across the street from the mass shooting at the grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. I used to live two stops away from the tear gas subway shooter in NYC.

@JillAdamski @NYC_DOT @helloDCWP @NYPDTransport @NYPDCentralPark @NYPDMTN That street does look it has too many vehicle lanes and not enough protected bike lanes. Seems like a design failure.

@Publicola_Lib21 My mother in law lives in Florida. It is better than NY in every way. We had virtually no homeless people on the streets for 20 years in NYC under Giuliani and Bloomberg. When DeBlasio came in he legalized street homelessness. Just like they did in California.

There‚Äôs a lot of justified skepticism of public-private partnerships out there, but a result that allows Breaking Ground to hire 100 more paid employees for outreach to street homeless New Yorkers should be deemed a plus. https://t.co/bVaMEDOUAf

Replaying the rebooted Wolfenstein games; while I still enjoy New Colossus, it was kind of obnoxious that they based the ads around "omg alt history Nazi America" but basically all you see of it is nuked NYC, post-apocalypse New Orleans, and one main street.
