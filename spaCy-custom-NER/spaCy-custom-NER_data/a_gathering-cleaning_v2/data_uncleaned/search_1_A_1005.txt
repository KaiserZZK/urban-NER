@salr_nyc @TCK_JRubano I don't mind long odds if it's really +EV (I'm a St Peter's paradox sucker!).  But come on you have to assume X tickets are bought (all eating into the EV), a Y discount for taxes and either lump sum or do a PV and there's just no way it's really +EV.

The Enes Kanter Freedom Foundation is registered at 104 W. 40th St. in NYC, the same address as Arlington Strategic Supplies and Manufacturing, a Gülen organization-owned weapons company.Don't take my word for it. Look it up. Then demand an explanation from him.

@wrldecentralize @ChrisKattan4eva @joe_mowrer @JCA_BelAir @DwightKSchruteA @katelinthicum Wall st was started as a slave trading market place. 40% of all revenue from the south went to NYC alone. How do you think these banks got so big in the entire WORLD?? The 350k enslaved humans in 1865 were worth 3x more (3.5 trillion) than all assets in the USA COMBINED.

@NYC_DOT @nyc311 Are the Grand St bike lanes being moved to one side to become a 2-way? I don't understand the photo comparison of the "existing" to the "proposed". Or was that picture just for the concrete barriers?

@CityofVancouver Isn’t that lovely. Drove down Hastings St today and did not think it could get worse than my last visit. No more excuses city. This is lack of real action for the last 20 years or more. You should all be ashamed and fired. Worse than NYC &amp; LA put together. Lawlessness gone wild!

@BriarBush They’re fab, not just for such beauty, but as a harbinger of longer days &amp; warmer weather around the corner.   I used to love seeing them in NYC too. There was a pink one in St Thomas churchyard visible over the 5th ave wall. I loved seeing it emerge in bloom in late winter.

@BranBrez @wight1984 @contrerasforca St. Paul's rent regulations feel like unusually strict rent stabilization. Annual rent increases are still permitted, they just aren't tied to inflation. NYC's few remaining RC units really are pretty close to a hard price cap.

@PHfloor The acronym is new, the idea is as old as mass transit itself. NYC has been building skyscrapers directly on top of subway stations for over a century. Take the 6 train to 23rd St and have a look for yourself!

@BluesNationCK @PrkSteakSchmuck @esbee23 @B1ackBruceWayne You said you can't compare it to every other city as if crime in St. Louis is exponentially worse. NYC is the only other city I've actually lived in so that's what I have to compare it to. What other cities have you lived in?

@BluesNationCK @PrkSteakSchmuck @esbee23 @B1ackBruceWayne I lived in New York City for 27 years. There are dangerous places there, but crime also happens in Midtown Manhattan. My husband was mugged at 2:30 in the afternoon on Wall St.  We also had our car stolen in a "nice" neighborhood (Park Slope). St. Louis is not scarier than NYC.

@RuoZhuyouUS When temps cool, maybe you can add the Hudson Heights hill on the NYC side and the other one going up to Main St in Fort Lee 😅

WSJ had story on Dem run cities as murder capitals: St. Louis and Balt. Well Chicago, Philly, NYC are all Dem run and death follows wherever Dems rule.

@HaileyLennonBTC It's nuts. In 2003 I took 1st (biz) trip alone to NYC. Stayed near Wall ST. I was nervous, but was assured it was safe. I walked a mile to a restaurant without worry.In 2007 took vacation to LA with friend. We drove, then walked, all over downtown into the night. Zero worries

@hellspawncrypto Won't happen. @SBF_FTX cornered crypto mkt w/ his Stanford connections (Mommy-Daddy liberal law profs w/ $$) along w/ MIT sociopathic mathwitshits, &amp; Jane St/NYC psycho avaricious hedge fund quant pigs, then took em out of U.S. tax/reg domiciles to start the great manipulation.

@KevinOBrien_chi @MarilynMosbyEsq An excellent start is to eliminate the Soros backed progressive soft on crime DAs in our nation's justice departments. OUT in SF now in Baltimore. Next let's finish the job in LA, then come for the DAs in St. Louis, Chicago, New Orleans, Philadelphia &amp; NYC.

@jamaicangymhead @bluntbabygirll @ianaarez @NotoriousDants @k7kt_ @Dom_Brady01 @Kamiiplus @stxphht Lol dude I live in NYC, I might make more than someone living in St. Louis but their standard of living might be better than mine. Fact that I make more doesn’t translate to better standard of living.

@Grossberger101 @RonFilipkowski Not believing what not seen on television is the #1 reason in my book.  TFG was on air being written as a huge (YUUUUUGE!) business genius, camera friendly, quick quips and snarling lips.  Had you lived in NYC or the ring around the boroughs quite a different take of the b*st*rd.

@taylormooresays Philly is a love child of NYC and Boston whereas Chicago feels like it was bred from NYC and old St. Louis.

@IronStache @tlang1061 @JohnFetterman Only back @johnferreman if you are a Dem/socialist.  And seeing how Democrats destroy everything they control, do so at your own peril. (I.e. NYC, LA, San Francisco, Chicago, St Louis … &amp; the 3 MOST Dem states LOSE Congressional seats as residents LEAVE.)
