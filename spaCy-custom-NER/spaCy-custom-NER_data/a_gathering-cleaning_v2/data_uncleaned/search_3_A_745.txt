More than 4,000 AAs were lynched across 20 states btwn 1877 &amp; 1950. 105 yrs ago today, July 28, 1917 nearly 10,000 AAs marched down 5th Ave, NYC, as what is known as the Silent Parade, to protest racial violence &amp; white supremacy in . Today we still face these same issues..

@ChristinaPushaw Sofia, Bulgaria has a nicer subway than the entire NYC system save for the 2nd Ave extension which took, no joke, 8 decades to build from inception to actual completion, and that's only three stops and a few miles of track.

Yesterday Satanic Panic was trending.  Today portals to hell.  Irony? Did someone use a talking board wrong? Or is it more fear-mongering? Curious minds want to know. I was once certain that a NYC 7th avenue subway station (with long escalators) was a portal every August.

@fredstaffordcs @pwrhungry @Atomicrod @SteveAplin @RachelMotte @MadiHilly @energybants @nukebarbarian business in Chicago on Michigan Avenue if there wasn't a lot of disposable income. I assume Bloomingdales kitty corner from the Hancock building is still doing a good business even if condos in the Hancock are insanely cheap compared to fancy NYC buildings..

@fredstaffordcs @pwrhungry @Atomicrod @SteveAplin @RachelMotte @MadiHilly @energybants @nukebarbarian Is it just that people in Chicago are "poorer" and that is why land is cheaper? Maybe, but even with the weaker Chicago economy compared to NYC there are still plenty of high end stores on Michigan Ave many of the same ones you see on Fifth Avenue.

@enforcelawsNYC @TransAlt @NYC_DOT just around the corner, the bottlenecks have turned Webster Ave by the Cross Bronx into a parking lot.  Fordham would be ten times worse.  and that business district needs the parking.

@TransAlt @ShawnGarcia_NYC of course!  the last thing anyone wants is another bottleneck.  look at Webster Ave by the Cross Bronx.  the bottlenecks have turned it into a parking lot!  Fordham would be soooo much worse.  they gotta cut out this bullshit.

@Based_Jedi @hillybillybaker During the era i lived in NYC Barnes and noble was in their growing phase. I watched many independent bookstores in NYC close as B&amp;N grew and online sales emerged.  In 1950 nyc had 386 bookstores. Today maybe 80. Book row (4th ave) used to have 50 stores. Now 2. Sad

Here is the project in question. DOT has just conveniently omitted the 48th and 51st st bike lanes from renderings.  We can argue that they are not "good" bike lanes, but they still exist. 5/https://t.co/9XvjoD1SCW https://t.co/iSlnxA0Yf2

A tiny part of the issue, but it's frustrating that this is what passes for local journalism in NYC, an article that uses a ceremonial name for *Nostrand Ave*, major Brooklyn thoroughfare, I assume bc that's what this stretch of it is called on Google Maps.
