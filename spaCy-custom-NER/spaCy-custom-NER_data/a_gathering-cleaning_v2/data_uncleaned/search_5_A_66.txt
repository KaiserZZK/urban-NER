@hgigante @joby_jacob @NYSDOT @Yewhomstda @StreetsblogNYC @QnsBPRichards @JimGennaro @LiuNewYork @NYC_DOT The elevators alone would cost millions for each station and both sides of the blvd alone. Private buses? How much would that cost? Road safety isn't  based on idealogy but rather on proven techniques and a cost analysis is always part of the planning process.

@Derrick_NYC I was on that train. They kicked everyone off. Then said we had to go to Astoria blvd so everyone ran to the ditmars bound side. When we got to the other platform, a Manhattan bound train pulled in and collected passengers. They seriously don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing

@NYC_DOT This is bull shit you can't safely go 30 or even 35 on northern Blvd and some other areas where there are speed cameras this is just to generate revenue. Also government is technically profiting on ur picture of you in your private place your vehicle

@QnsRide @joby_jacob @NYSDOT @Yewhomstda @StreetsblogNYC @QnsBPRichards @JimGennaro @LiuNewYork @NYC_DOT The proper remedy was to place two sided  Blvd elevators at subway ped underpasses hve  a private jitney supplement  in neighborhoods covering both sides of Blvd up/down the steep hills and true road safety upgrades.Not a plan based on ideology, that simply flips user hierarchy

@hgigante @joby_jacob @NYSDOT @Yewhomstda @StreetsblogNYC @QnsBPRichards @JimGennaro @LiuNewYork @NYC_DOT Did it meet everyone's need? Was it safe to cross for all? Yes, so far it's only half done but that's no reason to go backwards, only a reason to finish the job. Have you seen the capital plan to complete Qns Blvd?

Someone is measuring my strip of Queens Blvd. She was on the bike lane. I asked if she's from @NYC_DOT and she said yeah. When I asked for details she just she was measuring. Either she didn't wanna tell me or she just measures. Barriers coming soon?

@IHOP something needs to be done about your location on 135th and Adam Clayton Powell blvd in NYC. It‚Äôs never anyone at the front to seat anyone or take orders. I placed an online order at 10:19am this morning and I am still currently waiting on my order at 11:27. This is insane

@jilevin I live two blocks away from Riverside Blvd, NYC. Lots and lots of vacancies in the former Trump co-ops.

@JimTalbott75 @JessieSingerNYC @BobHoldenNYC @NYC_DOT Most bollards are bit higher than this and even have reflectors. Fencing like you see on Queens Blvd is better in my opinion. Prevents pedestrians from crossing at congested intersections.

@StreetsblogNYC @NYC_DOT I.. How did this even happen? Yeah I'm glad that no one was hurt but I'm trying to figure out how the hell that thing ended up like that. Honestly a lot of our streets need to be redesigned, look at queens BLVD or Northern BLVD in certain places.
