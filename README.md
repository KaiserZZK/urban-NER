# urban-NER
This is an intermediate project for my in-progress product submission for Chirp Developer Challenge '22. The purpose is to create customized Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags for spaCy, which will later be used for extracting urban location information from tweets.<br /><br />

While spaCy's built-in model is powerful in recognizing named entities like countries and organizations, it is not quite robust to identify the urban location information presented in social media posts.<br /><br />
